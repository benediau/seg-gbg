During the field season of 2024 we PIT-tagged migrating smolts in four streams along the Swedish west coast and followed up by conducting a beach seine net survey in the coastal area adjacent to the streams. <!--more-->  The survey provided information about prey choice of sea trout and species community in each area. Additionally, we collected epifaunal samples in each coastal area to estimate prey abundance and benthic community composition in eelgrass meadows and unvegetated sites.

In the autumn, we visited cormorant colonies around our sites to investigate potential cormorant predation of our PIT-tagged sea trout. By using portable antennas, we scanned for PIT-tags around the colonies used by the cormorant during the spring and summer.
