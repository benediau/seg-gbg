The SEG is hard at work! 
<!--more-->

Last week Niklas nailed his thesis titled <em>“Parasite host interaction between the freshwater  pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), the impact from glochidia larvae on the host”</em> at Zoologen. His [defense](https://www.gu.se/evenemang/niklas-wengstrom-parasite-host-interaction-between-the-freshwater-pearl-mussel-margaritifera-margaritifera-and-brown-trout-salmo-trutta-the-impact) will take place on the 11th of March.

Interesting bachelor and master projects are underway. Pernilla is working hard on identifying the insects caught at the study sites connected to the [NOBROOK](https://seggothenburg.com/about/nobrook/) project, data which she will use as the basis for her thesis about the effects on the benthic invertebrate composition as a result of the brook and brown trout interactions.

Matilda is busy with data analysis and report writing for her thesis work on juvenile sea trout investigating behavioral differences between offspring of long and short distance migrants. Sebastian is gearing up to start his field work soon. 

SEG members and up-and-coming bachelor and master students have been back at the study sites checking the winter conditions of the NOBROOK streams as well, and provided the weather and water levels allow for it; the fish will be tracked with portable antennas during the coming weeks and will provide valuable data for the NOBROOK project, as well as interesting thesis material about the winter locations of the brook and brown trout.

Madeleine spent two weeks in Tromsø this month on the course “Fish-migrations; science, management and politics” at [UiT](https://en.uit.no/startsida), with a heavy focus on learning about various methods of telemetry and how to track fish movement (while she was there she was lucky enough to see some northern lights as well!). Now she’s focusing on planning the upcoming field season including setting up a smolt trap for the [MAPS](https://seggothenburg.com/about/maps/) project in Haga Å.
