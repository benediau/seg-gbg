My research interest focus on fish behaviour and ecology.

During my PhD, I studied interspecific interactions between native brown trout and invasive brook trout in Sweden, focusing on behaviour and morphology. I have also studied fish learning and the importance of social and private learning when it comes to angling induced hook avoidance.

Master project with SEG and SMOLTRACK. 
The first part of my project is a literature review for the European research group SMOLTRACK. The aim of my literature review is to identify knowledge gaps on thermal and hydraulic influences on salmonid smolt run-timing, freshwater growth and survival, both during downstream migration and marine survival. I will also describe the thermal range of salmon in the eastern Altantic.

The second part of my project is a field study on brown trout smolt in Lillån, a small tributary to lake Vättern. The aim here is to Investigate smolt survival and selection pressure when passing through a manmade lake during their migration from Lillån to lake Vättern.
