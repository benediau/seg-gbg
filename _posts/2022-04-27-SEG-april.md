Fieldwork season has begun!
<!--more-->
The team has been enjoying the sunshine while collecting data for both the [NOBROOK](https://seggothenburg.com/about/nobrook/) and the [MAPS](https://seggothenburg.com/about/maps/) projects this month.

In NOBROOK the 8 streams in Borås are starting to be habitat mapped to develop a trout habitat score for each one. Tracking of the tagged fish is now complete for this season so once we have the rest of the habitat data Kim and Christian will be able to see how the fish are utilizing the habitat at each site.

In MAPS the focus has been on the smolt trap in Haga å, Billdal. The trap went up early April and already several hundred smolts have been through, including some of the fish we tagged last Autumn. Each fish has been measured and assessed for smoltification status. Our bachelor’s student Emelie will be analyzing what kind of relationship there is between discharge/temperature and peaks in migration.

At Zoologen Magnus and Christian have been hard at work preparing for an exciting eel project investigating fish ladders and glass eels. Everything is ready to go and the experiment begins now, we look forward to seeing what the eels do! 



The SEG is getting ready for spring! 


First off a massive congratulations to Dr. Niklas Wengström on completing his PhD! It was great to hear the culmination of his many years of hard work and dedication in his thesis <em>“Parasite host interaction between the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), the impact from glochidia larvae on the host”</em>.

Prior to Niklas’ defence SEG held a workshop where several members of SEG got to both present their research and hear about the research of the visiting academics that made up Niklas’ committee. There was a diverse range of topics and it was fantastic to mingle and share ideas in person again.

After a lot of effort preparing samples Benedikte has sent fin clips and invertebrates from the stream sites in Borås to the lab for isotope analysis. We look forward to getting the results in a few weeks. In the meantime more tracking has been done for the [NOBROOK](https://seggothenburg.com/about/nobrook/) project by Kim and Christian and planning for the upcoming field season is underway which will include further mapping and examinig of the stream habitats and tagging of fish.

For the [MAPS](https://seggothenburg.com/about/maps/) project the focus has been on getting the  [stationary antenna system](https://seggothenburg.com/maps/2022/03/21/maps-antennas/) and smolt trap up and running before the juvenile sea trout start migrating in early April. There are now 3 functioning antenna in the stream and it is hoped another one will be built in the next few weeks. 

The location of the smolt trap has been decided and construction has begun with the help of [Miljöteknik i Väst](http://miljoteknikivast.se/).
