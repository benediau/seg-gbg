The initial field work for the NOBROOK project has begun! 

<!--more-->

 This autumn we have started the process of tagging fish in several stream sections in Bor√•s with both allopatric populations with only brown trout and sympatric populations of both brown trout and brook trout. In total we have tagged and collected data from around 400 fish. The following eight weeks after tagging we have been back to each stream section once per week and walked the stretches with portable antennas to track their movement. The final week we recaptured several of our tagged fish and measured their growth this fall. The rest of the winter we will plan for the next field season which will begin early spring!
