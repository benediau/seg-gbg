At the end of May Johan and Madeleine set off to France for a few days to check out a potential stream site for the MAPS project. <!--more--> They headed to a small brook section of the river Oir in the countryside of Rennes and had the chance to join the team at INRAE during one of their annual monitoring studies. The narrow brook is a very productive spawning area for both brown trout and Atlantic salmon and is regularly surveyed three times a year. SEG return in the autumn to work with them again sampling and PIT tagging some of the juvenile trout.

In June it was time to head over to Northwest Norway for habitat mapping and invertebrate sampling in the system at Beiarn, this data will used in the predictive modelling work for the MAPS project. We also took the chance to visit the lake system at Kjerringöy where we plan to sample and tag fish in September for the work on migratory patterns.

Now, Madeleine is presenting her project plan and preliminary findings with a poster at the International Society of Behavioural Ecology Conference 2022 in Stockholm.



Furthermore, in June each stretched was electro fished and more fish of both species were tagged and boldness score, the fish that we managed to recapture from last fall's tagging were also scored this year. 

Other than the field work that's been done in Borås, we also had the chance to visit our collaborator and friend Libor in Lunz, Austria. The plan moving forward is hopefully to work together on some experiments there next summer. In order to get a more detailed perspective of the effects of remvoing brook trout with different behavioural triats we will be conducting these experiments in artificial stream channels located in Lunz. This will be conducted as a supplement to the field based approach taking place in Borås.

The plan for the time being is to examine the behavioral phenotypes of the fish (brown and brook trout that will be caught in Austria), and we will design the
enclosures so as to create different subhabitats of different qualities. This will allow us to
determine which fish is the most dominant one as the most dominant fish will inhabit the best
habitat (i.e. the most stable water flow and best food supply), and we will subsequently remove
this fish and observing the response of the remaining population. The enclosures will emulate
both sympatric sections with both species, as well as allopatric sections with only brown trout.
