    excerpt: "My research interest focus on fish behaviour and ecology."
    description: "During my PhD, I studied interspecific interactions between native brown trout and invasive brook trout in Sweden, focusing on behaviour and morphology. I have also studied fish learning and the importance of social and private learning when it comes to angling induced hook avoidance."

    description: "I am currently doing a masters in conservation biology at the University of Gothenburg. I am writing my thesis together with the SEG with focus on investigating if migration patterns correlate with behavior in the offspring of sea trout. Outside of the office I enjoy climbing and hiking!"

    description: "The first part of my project is a literature review for the European research group SMOLTRACK. The aim of my literature review is to identify knowledge gaps on thermal and hydraulic influences on salmonid smolt run-timing, freshwater growth and survival, both during downstream migration and marine survival. I will also describe the thermal range of salmon in the eastern Altantic. The second part of my project is a field study on brown trout smolt in Lillån, a small tributary to lake Vättern. The aim here is to Investigate smolt survival and selection pressure when passing through a manmade lake during their migration from Lillån to lake Vättern."
