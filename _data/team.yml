    excerpt: "Professor Johan Höjesjö leads the Salmonid Ecology Group (SEG)."
    description: "He has been working on behavioural variation, habitat preference and migratory bahaviour in salmonids in various context over 20 years. He is also co-chairing the ICES working group [WGTRUTTA](https://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/WGTRUTTA.aspx) and is responsible for two in-depth courses; [Conservation biology in aquatic environments](https://www.gu.se/studera/hitta-utbildning/naturvard-i-vattenmiljoer-bio283) and the master course [Stream Ecology and Fish conservation](https://www.gu.se/studera/hitta-utbildning/ekologi-och-fiskevard-i-rinnande-vatten-bio566)"

    excerpt: "My research interest focus on fish behaviour and ecology."
    description: "During my PhD, I studied interspecific interactions between native brown trout and invasive brook trout in Sweden, focusing on behaviour and morphology. I have also studied fish learning and the importance of social and private learning when it comes to angling induced hook avoidance."

    excerpt: "Master project with SEG and SMOLTRACK."
    description: "The first part of my project is a literature review for the European research group SMOLTRACK. The aim of my literature review is to identify knowledge gaps on thermal and hydraulic influences on salmonid smolt run-timing, freshwater growth and survival, both during downstream migration and marine survival. I will also describe the thermal range of salmon in the eastern Altantic. The second part of my project is a field study on brown trout smolt in Lillån, a small tributary to lake Vättern. The aim here is to Investigate smolt survival and selection pressure when passing through a manmade lake during their migration from Lillån to lake Vättern."
